First off, thanks for checking out my website! My name is Randy Thomas and I am an artist, writer, and love communication in all of its various forms. Professionally, I am an Online Content & Social Media Manager for a PR company here in central Florida.

My favorite title is "Uncle Silly." This honored designation was bestowed on me by my wonderful, fantastic, creative, beautiful, and amazing nieces!

I am a Christian who also happens to be gay. I celebrate my faith in Christ and love meeting people. It truly is a joy to experience other's stories.

In my former career as the last Executive Vice President of Exodus International, I contributed to several books and was featured in a full-page ad in _The Los Angeles Times,_ as well as Chuck Colson's book _The Good Life,_ and in media outlets around the world. Of course that was from an ex-gay perspective I no longer promote or encourage. I am also supportive of efforts to end conversion therapy for minors. I am increasingly speaking against efforts to "change" a person's sexual orientation through spiritual shame, manipulation, and condemnation.

I came out again on January 12th, 2015 after 21 years in the ex-gay world (1992 -- 2013 when we shut down Exodus.) It's not been the easiest transition but I feel more free than I ever have before. Today I rejoice in the open doors that grace unlocks, and enjoy experiencing the beauty and image of God in every person I have the good fortune to meet.

My goal is to use every last ounce of my creative energy and gifts to honor, bless, and to encourage others. Let's connect on social media, or message me confidentially through the form below. I'd love to hear about your inspiration, your story, and passion.
