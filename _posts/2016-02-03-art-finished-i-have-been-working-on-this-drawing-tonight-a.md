title: "#Art finished! I have been working on this drawing tonight and the additions just didn't feel right. So I reverted it back to where it was last night. Yay for digital drawing! Now I know it is complete. I also know the name, with help from a loved one, meet \"Finding a place to land...\" When that popped in my head during our discussion I got choked up... So there ya' go. Thank you everyone for chiming in and for your support. I love going through the creative process with you! #ApplePencil #iPadPro #Artsy #Instaart #Abstract #Design #Drawing #GayArtist"
